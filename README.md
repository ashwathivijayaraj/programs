Welcome to my Programs repository! This is a collection of various programming assignments and practice codes I wrote during my college years, organized by language for easy navigation and reference.

📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific programming language or domain:

- Java – Programs written in Java
- Python – Scripts and projects written in Python
- C – C language practice codes
- DBMS – SQL queries and database-related code

✨ Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of my coding journey during college
- A quick reference for basic programming logic and syntax
- A resource for others who are learning these languages

📌 Notes

- Most of the code was written for academic purposes, so it may not always follow industry best practices.
- Folder names and files are kept clean and descriptive.
- New folders or updates may be added over time as I revisit or improve these codes.

🔧 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to any language folder.
3. Open and run the programs using your preferred IDE or terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashwathivijayaraj/programs.git
